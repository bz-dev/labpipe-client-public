# LabPipe Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/colin-bz/labpipe-server-public.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/colin-bz/labpipe-server-public)

Client to work with LabPipe Server to assist with data collection:

- **dynamic**: server-side form configuration
- **simple**: wizard style step-by-step guide through forms
- **standalone**: server connection only required at first use*

<sup>*</sup> Server connection is still required if you wish to use functions provided on the server, e.g. notification, backup, and other post upload processes.
